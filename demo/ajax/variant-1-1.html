    <h2>The lightbox and fallbacks</h2>
    <p>
        Please keep in mind users use the web very differently!<br/>
        It might be a user wants to open a lightbox-link in a new tab using e.g. the right click/context menu.
        In this case the lightbox will do ... nothing. It simply can't. So you have to care about a fallback!
    </p>
    <p>
        In general you should build a server-side switch:<br/>
        <b>If any JavaScript does request content</b> there will be an additional header field "<i>X-Requested-With: <b>XMLHttpRequest</b></i>".
        So does the lightbox. If this field and value was set, you can respond with partial HTML. If not you should return a full page.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not want to have a full page available (because you don't care about defaults and an easy to use web ;)
        consider to NOT use links for binding the lightbox. Use one of the multiple other possibilities to bind the lightbox!
